You need two storage systems:

1️⃣ Relational DB (PostgreSQL or SQLite)

For fast product lookup by filters:

product_id

brand

name

ingredients

allergens

nutrition values

category

→ This is where SQL queries are generated by the LLM.

2️⃣ Vector DB (Qdrant, Chroma)

To store:

product descriptions

embeddings of ingredients

embeddings of nutritional text

embeddings of product images (optional)

→ This enables “semantic search” when the user describes:

“I want a lactose-free drink, similar to almond milk but cheaper”.

or

“something like Nutella but healthier”.
