TODO: 

-Gather the origin of the product following some standards from the description
-Get the ingredients from the OCR data, as it's more reliable and specific.
-Get the allergens from the product description
-How to get the brand of the product? I think that through the OCR is the best way 
-Should I standarize measurements for kg and Liter or just write the measurement used as another attribute? 
Standarize is better for future queries or just use common sense or standize based on the category. 
-Should I use a VLM for every case, just for the ones that OCR + LLM is not enough or never? 
-How to store the information, so it's easier for the RAG or query LLM to gather it easier. I mean for example latas de cerveza, 
should I store it as a string, as the final weight?
