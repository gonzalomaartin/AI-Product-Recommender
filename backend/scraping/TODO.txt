TODO: 

-Make the scraper modular by dividing it into functions, which makes testing and understanding the code much easier. 
-How to apply concurrency to gather information about different products? Should I do it, if I can only do 1 VLM + 1 LLM at a time, 
and this is the process that takes much more time than anything else?
